# Gitlab branch exporter

- This repository stores the code of a program i made to export all branches from a repository to external folders. Also, the code is capable of merging all those branches into master with each of them organised in different folders. 

# How to use :

- Change the destination paths to the two folders needed, one for the original repository and the second as destination folder.

- To just copy the branches, just execute the code.

- To merge the branches into one, uncomment all the other lines.
